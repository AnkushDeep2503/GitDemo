# Question: Write a python program to find average of two numbers entered by the user.

# a = input ("Enter first number: ")
# a = int (a)
# print (a)
# b = input ("Enter second number: ")
# b = int (b)
# print (b)
# print ("The average of a and b is: ", ((a+b)/2))

a = input ("Enter the first number: ")
a = float (a)
b = input ("Enter the second number: ")
b = float (b)
avrg = (a+b)/2
print ("The average of two number is: ", avrg)
